for and against : electric car vs petrol car 
price 
cheaper over time 
range and recharge (quick stop for petrol and everywhere, city or campaign)
environment (battery, combustion)


Petrol car
advantages :
- cheaper to purchase than electric car. About 50% percent less than electric car 
- quick stop to refill the tank and we can find a station everywhere 
- better autonomy like 2 or 3 times more than an electric car 

disadvantages : 
- long time environmental impact because the combustion of the petrol pollutes more than electricity
- long time more expensive, the petrol is more expensive than electricity
